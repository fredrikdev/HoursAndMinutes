		<span class="title">Tasks & Comments</span><br><br>
		Tasks are userdefined items (ie. 'Working with This' may be one task, and 'Working with That' may be another). All tasks has their own timetable, allowing you to know exactly what you was doing one day.
		<br><br>
		Hours and Minutes will let you create your own tasks, and additionally you may even create Rules, bound to any of the tasks, to remind you after a specified period of time.
		<br><br>
		Here are some examples of tasks that you could create:
		<br>
		<li>Painting in Photoshop
		<li>Surfing the Web
		<li>Playing Games
		<br>
		<br>
		Or, perhaps more serious:
		<br>
		<li>Customer A
		<li>Customer B
		<li>Customer C

		<br><br>
		Comments are useful to help you remind what <u>exactly</u> it was that you were doing at a specified time. Say that you've setup a task called
		"Working with Project A" - you might want to add comments for when you are "Writing Documentation", "Having a meeting with the staff", "Is creating the UML scheme" etc.
