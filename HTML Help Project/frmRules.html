		<span class="title">Rules</span><br><br>
		Rules are pretty much like reminders, but bound to a specific task. Rules can be setup to remind you after working with a specific task for a specified period of time. There is no limitation of how many rules each task can have.
		<br><br>
		<span class="subtitle">Scenario</span>
		<br><br>
		A customer has paid for 3 hours of your valuable time, not more, not less. Create a rule on the task that you've assigned to your customer, make the rule remind you when 3 hours has past in one day.
