		<span class="title">Preferences</span><br><br>

		The Preferences tab handles all settings used by Hours and Minutes. To change a setting, simply enter a value in the textfield then click Apply or OK to save (clicking Cancel would undo the change).
		<br><br>
		<span class="subtitle">Timing Preferences</span><br><br>
		Stop monitoring after 3 idle minutes. With this checkbox checked, you enable Hours and Minutes to detect time that you are idle (that is: time that you do not use your computer). Idle time is removed from the total time, once idle. Thereby, with this option, you'll not log anything but active minutes!
		<br><br>
		<span class="subtitle">Saving Preferences</span><br><br>
		Autosave every 15 minutes. With this checkbox checked, you enable Hours and Minutes to save your time data to disk at the given interval. This is especially useful if your computer doesn't work the way you like.
		<br><br>
		<span class="subtitle">Tasks</span><br><br>
		Remind me to select task when I go active. This option will cause the switch-task dialog to show each time that the computer goes active (after an idle session). The dialog allows you to switch task, or use the current one. Just for reminding you.
		<br><br>
		Tasks. This button will cause a menu to show, allowing you to switch task, add a comment to the current date & task, modify tasks, or edit the log.
